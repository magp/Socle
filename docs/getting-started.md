# Getting started

## Requirements

- Node.js 20 or later (build script only — no Node at runtime)
- Firefox or Chrome on Android or desktop

iOS Safari is not supported. Direct users to install Firefox.

## Scaffold a new app

```bash
npx socle my-app
```

The CLI prompts for your app name and which optional modules to include, then creates `./my-app/` with everything wired up.

## What you get

```
my-app/
  _lib/                ← library code — never edit these files
    core/              ← AppElement, Router, Store, IDB, SW
    modules/           ← modules you selected (gestures, sync, etc.)
    lib-version.json   ← records the library version and installed modules
  app/
    components/        ← your Web Components
    pages/             ← your page components, one per route
    store/             ← your store actions and schema extensions
    main.js            ← app entry point
  tests/
    unit/              ← Vitest unit tests
    e2e/               ← Playwright E2E tests
  utils/
    build.js           ← build script, edit if you need custom behaviour
  .github/
    workflows/
      deploy.yml       ← deploys to GitHub Pages on push to main
  index.html
  manifest.json
  package.json
```

Your code lives in `app/`. Everything in `_lib/` is owned by the library and updated by `npx socle update`.

## Build

```bash
node utils/build.js
```

The build script:
- Hashes `app/main.js` and all static assets — filenames change when content changes
- Injects your app version into the built JS
- Generates `dist/sw.js` from the library's SW template with your asset list baked in
- Writes `dist/version.json` for the update-notification flow
- Processes `index.html` with the hashed asset filenames

Output goes to `dist/`. Serve `dist/` locally during development or let GitHub Actions do it on deploy.

## Deploy to GitHub Pages

Push to `main`. The included `deploy.yml` workflow builds the app and deploys `dist/` to GitHub Pages automatically.

Before the first deploy, enable GitHub Pages in your repository settings: **Settings → Pages → Source → GitHub Actions**.

Your app will be live at `https://your-username.github.io/your-repo-name/`.

The build script automatically sets the correct base path in all asset URLs — no manual configuration needed.

## Write your first component

All components extend `AppElement` from `_lib/core/app-element.js`. Create a file in `app/components/` and register a custom element:

```js
// app/components/hello-world/hello-world.js
import { AppElement } from '../../../_lib/core/app-element.js';

class HelloWorld extends AppElement {
  template() {
    return `
      <style>
        :host { display: block; padding: var(--space-md); }
        p { color: var(--color-text-primary); font-size: var(--font-size-body); }
      </style>
      <p>Hello, world.</p>
    `;
  }
}

customElements.define('hello-world', HelloWorld);
```

Use it in your page HTML or from another component's `template()`:

```html
<hello-world></hello-world>
```

Design tokens from `_lib/core/styles/tokens.css` are available in any component style block via `var(--token-name)` — no extra imports needed.

See [components.md](components.md) for the full component guide including tiers, the subscribe/unsubscribe lifecycle, and targeted DOM update patterns.

## Add a page

Your scaffolded app comes with routing wired up. `main.js` registers `home-page` and `not-found-page` as the initial routes.

To add a new page:

1. Create a component in `app/pages/`:

```js
// app/pages/goal-page.js
import { AppElement } from '../../_lib/core/app-element.js';

class GoalPage extends AppElement {
  template() {
    return `
      <style>:host { display: block; }</style>
      <main>
        <h1>Goal</h1>
      </main>
    `;
  }
}

customElements.define('goal-page', GoalPage);
```

2. Register it in `app/main.js`:

```js
import './pages/goal-page.js';

router.routes = [
  { path: '/',          component: 'home-page' },
  { path: '/goals/:id', component: 'goal-page' },   // ← add this
  { path: '*',          component: 'not-found-page' },
];
```

3. Navigate to it from anywhere in your app. The import path is relative to your file's location:

```js
// from app/pages/goal-page.js
import { navigate } from '../../_lib/core/router/router.js';

navigate('/goals/42');
```

Route parameters (`:id`) are URI-decoded and set on the page component as `this.params.id` before it renders.

See [architecture.md](architecture.md) for the full router documentation including hard-refresh behaviour and the SW navigation intercept.

## Update the library

```bash
npx socle update
```

This replaces `_lib/` only. Your `app/` code is never touched. If the update includes a new IDB schema version, the command flags it and you run `/migration` to review and apply it.
