# Architecture

## Monorepo layout

```
Socle/
  core/        Runtime library — copied to _lib/core/ in every scaffolded app
  modules/     Optional runtime modules — copied to _lib/modules/
  scaffold/    Template for new apps — mirrors the exact app directory structure
  cli/         npx socle entry point
  reference-app/  Real app using the library, proves every feature works
  docs/
```

`core/` and `modules/` contain browser code that runs in the app. `scaffold/` contains project tooling and config files that the developer owns and can edit.

## The `_lib/` boundary

When you scaffold a project, `core/` and your selected `modules/` are copied into `_lib/`. This is the single most important architectural rule:

**`_lib/` files never import from `app/`.** The dependency arrow points one way only:

```
app/ → _lib/
```

If any `_lib/` file references anything outside `_lib/`, the update mechanism breaks. `npx socle update` replaces `_lib/` entirely — it can only do this safely because `_lib/` has no knowledge of your app code.

## Build system

The build script at `utils/build.js` is plain Node.js with no dependencies beyond built-ins. It runs at deploy time and produces everything in `dist/`:

```
dist/
  main.[hash].js    ← hashed app entry point with APP_VERSION injected
  sw.js             ← Service Worker generated from _lib/core/sw.js
  version.json      ← { version, buildTime } for the update-notification flow
  index.html        ← processed with hashed asset filenames
  manifest.json     ← copied from project root
  _lib/             ← copy of _lib/ (ES modules need all imports present in dist/)
  app/              ← copy of app/ (page components imported by main.[hash].js)
```

Content hashing means browsers cache aggressively — a filename only changes when its content changes, so unchanged files are served from cache indefinitely.

### BASE_PATH

Apps deployed to GitHub Pages live at `https://user.github.io/repo-name/`, not `/`. The build script reads `BASE_PATH` from the environment and prefixes all asset URLs:

```bash
BASE_PATH=/my-app/ node utils/build.js
```

The included `deploy.yml` sets this automatically from the repository name. Local development uses the default `/`.

## Router

The router uses the History API (`pushState` / `popstate`). There is no hash routing.

### `navigate(path)`

Call `navigate()` from anywhere in your app to change the route. The import path depends on your file's location relative to `_lib/`:

```js
// from app/pages/goal-page.js
import { navigate } from '../../_lib/core/router/router.js';

navigate('/goals/42');
```

This pushes the path to the browser history and dispatches a `navigate` event on `window`. The `<app-router>` component listens for both `navigate` and `popstate` events and swaps the current page component accordingly.

Do not call `history.pushState()` directly — it will update the URL but not trigger the router.

### `<app-router>`

Place `<app-router>` in your `index.html`. It is the single outlet for all page components:

```html
<body>
  <app-router></app-router>
  <script type="module" src="%%MAIN_JS%%"></script>
</body>
```

In `main.js`, set its `routes` property after import:

```js
import '../_lib/core/router/app-router.js';
import './pages/home-page.js';
import './pages/not-found-page.js';

const router = document.querySelector('app-router');
router.routes = [
  { path: '/',         component: 'home-page' },
  { path: '/goals/:id', component: 'goal-page' },
  { path: '*',         component: 'not-found-page' },
];
```

Routes are matched in order — first match wins. Use `*` as the last entry to catch unmatched paths.

### Route parameters

Segments prefixed with `:` are captured as named parameters and set on the page component as a `params` property before it renders. Use them directly in `template()`:

```js
class GoalPage extends AppElement {
  template() {
    return `<main><h1>Goal ${this.params.id}</h1></main>`;
  }
}
```

Parameter values are URI-decoded automatically.

### Page components

Every page component must wrap its content in `<main>` so assistive technologies can navigate directly to page content:

```js
class GoalPage extends AppElement {
  template() {
    return `
      <style>:host { display: block; }</style>
      <main>
        <h1>Goal detail</h1>
      </main>
    `;
  }
}

customElements.define('goal-page', GoalPage);
```

### Hard refresh and the SW navigation intercept

When a user navigates to `/goals/42` and then hard-refreshes, the browser requests `/goals/42` from the server. A static file server returns 404 — there is no file at that path.

The Service Worker solves this: it intercepts all navigation requests (requests with `mode === 'navigate'`) and returns the cached `index.html` instead. The app shell loads, the router reads the current URL, and renders the correct page. This is why offline-first and SPA routing work together without a server-side fallback.

The SW intercept is active after the first visit, once the SW has installed and taken control of the page.

## Store and IDB

The Store is the single source of truth for all app state. Components never touch IndexedDB directly — every write goes through `Store.dispatch()`, every read comes via `Store.subscribe()`.

### Data model — append-only event log

All data is stored as an append-only log of events in IndexedDB. An event records what happened, not what the current state is:

```js
{
  id:         '550e8400-...',   // crypto.randomUUID()
  deviceId:   null,             // set by apps using P2P; null for single-device
  recordedAt: 1715000000000,    // Date.now() at write time — immutable
  occurredAt: 1715000000000,    // when the real-world event happened — correctable
  type:       'goal:added',
  payload:    { title: 'Run a 5k' },
}
```

`recordedAt` is the log ordering key — it records when the device wrote the event and is immutable. `occurredAt` records when the event happened in the real world; it can be user-supplied and corrected without affecting data integrity.

State is calculated by replaying the full event log through your reducer on every boot.

### Boot

Call `boot()` at the top of `main.js` and `await` it before the router or any component renders. Nothing else touches IDB at startup — this is the only entry point.

```js
import { boot } from '../_lib/core/store/store.js';
import { reducer } from './store/reducer.js';

await boot({ dbName: 'my-app', reducer });
```

`boot()` options:

| Option | Required | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `dbName` | yes | IDB database name — use your app name |
| `reducer` | yes | `(state, event) => newState` — called for every event on replay |
| `version` | no | IDB schema version — defaults to library's `CURRENT_VERSION` |
| `deviceId` | no | Identifies this device in P2P contexts — omit for single-device apps |

### Dispatch

```js
import { dispatch } from '../_lib/core/store/store.js';

await dispatch('goal:added', { title: 'Run a 5k' });

// With a custom occurredAt (e.g. user entered a past date):
await dispatch('goal:added', { title: 'Past goal' }, pastTimestamp);
```

`dispatch` writes the event to IDB, runs the reducer, then notifies subscribers of any changed state keys.

### Subscribe

```js
import { subscribe, unsubscribe } from '../_lib/core/store/store.js';

class GoalList extends AppElement {
  subscribe() {
    this._onGoals = goals => { /* update DOM */ };
    Store.subscribe('goals', this._onGoals);
  }
  unsubscribe() {
    Store.unsubscribe('goals', this._onGoals);
  }
}
```

`subscribe(key, cb)` calls `cb` immediately with the current value, then again whenever that top-level state key changes. Call `unsubscribe` in the component's `unsubscribe()` lifecycle method to avoid memory leaks.

### Writing a reducer

Your reducer lives in `app/store/reducer.js`. It receives the current state and one event, and must return a new state object:

```js
export function reducer(state, event) {
  switch (event.type) {
    case 'goal:added':
      return { ...state, goals: [...(state.goals ?? []), event.payload] };
    default:
      return state;
  }
}
```

The reducer must be a pure function — no side effects, no IDB calls, no mutation of the existing state object. The Store detects changes using reference equality (`!==`), so always return a new object when state changes.

### Schema migrations

The IDB schema is versioned from day one. Migrations live in `core/idb/migrations.js` — add a new function to the array when you need a new object store or index:

```js
// core/idb/migrations.js
const migrations = [
  null,       // slot 0 — IDB versions start at 1
  db => {     // version 1 — initial schema
    const store = db.createObjectStore('events', { keyPath: 'id' });
    store.createIndex('by_recordedAt', 'recordedAt');
  },
  db => {     // version 2 — add a new store
    db.createObjectStore('snapshots', { keyPath: 'id' });
  },
];
```

Migrations run inside `boot()` before any state is replayed and before any UI renders. A failed migration throws, halting app startup visibly — it never silently corrupts data.

### API reference

#### `boot({ dbName, reducer, version?, deviceId? })`

Opens the IDB database, runs any pending migrations, replays the event log through `reducer`, and sets the initial state. Must be `await`ed in `main.js` before anything else runs. Rejects if migrations fail.

#### `dispatch(type, payload, occurredAt?)`

Writes a complete event to IDB, applies the reducer, and notifies subscribers of changed state keys. Throws if called before `boot`. Returns a Promise that resolves when the write is complete.

#### `subscribe(key, cb)`

Registers `cb` for changes to a top-level state key. Calls `cb` immediately with the current value. Call in your component's `subscribe()` lifecycle method.

#### `unsubscribe(key, cb)`

Removes a previously registered callback. No-op if the callback was not registered. Call in your component's `unsubscribe()` lifecycle method.

#### `setState(key, value)`

Updates a top-level state key in memory and notifies subscribers. Does not write to IDB — the value does not survive a page reload.

Use for ephemeral runtime state: UI flags, detection results, or any value that is not a domain event and should not appear in the event log.

```js
import { setState } from '../_lib/core/store/store.js';

setState('updateAvailable', true);
```

**Notes** — calling `setState` before `boot` is safe but the value will be wiped when `boot` runs and replays the event log.

#### `getState()`

Returns the current state snapshot. Use in tests and for debugging. Do not use in production component code — use `subscribe()` instead.

#### `reset()`

Clears all module state. **Test isolation only — never call in production code.**

## Service Worker

The SW source lives at `_lib/core/sw.js` — library-owned, never edited directly. The build processes it into `dist/sw.js`, injecting:

- `CACHE_VERSION` — `{version}-{hash}`, changes on every build
- `ASSETS` — the full enumerated list of files in `_lib/` and `app/`, with correct `BASE_PATH` prefixes
- `BASE_PATH` — URL prefix for navigation intercept

Cache strategy by resource type:

| Resource | Strategy |
|----------|----------|
| `version.json` | Network only — never cached, always fresh |
| `index.html`, JS, CSS | Cache first — updated via SW lifecycle |
| Static assets (hashed) | Cache first — filename changes when content changes |
| Other same-origin resources | Runtime caching — cached on first fetch |

On activate, all caches that do not match `CACHE_VERSION` are deleted, cleaning up stale assets from previous versions. The SW calls `clients.claim()` so it takes control on first install without requiring a page reload.

The build script enumerates every file under `_lib/` and `app/` for the pre-cache list, following symlinks. Any file added to either directory is automatically included on the next build.

For the full update flow — `<sw-manager>`, `<update-banner>`, skip-waiting, and the `version.json` check — see [sw-update-flow.md](sw-update-flow.md).

## Reference app

`reference-app/` is structured identically to a scaffolded user project, with one difference: `_lib/` is a symlink to the monorepo's `core/` and `modules/` directories rather than a copy. Library code changes are reflected immediately without a sync step.

The reference app proves every library feature works end-to-end before it is considered complete. If a feature cannot be demonstrated meaningfully in the reference app, it is not done.
