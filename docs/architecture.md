```

`core/` and `modules/` contain browser code that runs in the app. `scaffold/` contains project tooling and config files that the developer owns and can edit.

## The `_lib/` boundary

When you scaffold a project, `core/` and your selected `modules/` are copied into `_lib/`. This is the single most important architectural rule:

**`_lib/` files never import from `app/`.** The dependency arrow points one way only:

```
app/ → _lib/
```

If any `_lib/` file references anything outside `_lib/`, the update mechanism breaks. `npx socle update` replaces `_lib/` entirely — it can only do this safely because `_lib/` has no knowledge of your app code.

## Build system

The build script at `utils/build.js` is plain Node.js with no dependencies beyond built-ins. It runs at deploy time and produces everything in `dist/`:

```
dist/
  main.[hash].js    ← hashed app entry point with APP_VERSION injected
  sw.js             ← Service Worker generated from _lib/core/sw.js
  version.json      ← { version, buildTime } for the update-notification flow
  index.html        ← processed with hashed asset filenames
  manifest.json     ← copied from project root
  _lib/             ← copy of _lib/ (ES modules need all imports present in dist/)
  app/              ← copy of app/ (page components imported by main.[hash].js)
```

Content hashing means browsers cache aggressively — a filename only changes when its content changes, so unchanged files are served from cache indefinitely.

### BASE_PATH

Apps deployed to GitHub Pages live at `https://user.github.io/repo-name/`, not `/`. The build script reads `BASE_PATH` from the environment and prefixes all asset URLs:

```bash
BASE_PATH=/my-app/ node utils/build.js
```

The included `deploy.yml` sets this automatically from the repository name. Local development uses the default `/`.

## Router

The router uses the History API (`pushState` / `popstate`). There is no hash routing.

### `navigate(path)`

Call `navigate()` from anywhere in your app to change the route. The import path depends on your file's location relative to `_lib/`:

```js
// from app/pages/goal-page.js
import { navigate } from '../../_lib/core/router/router.js';

navigate('/goals/42');
```

This pushes the path to the browser history and dispatches a `navigate` event on `window`. The `<app-router>` component listens for both `navigate` and `popstate` events and swaps the current page component accordingly.

Do not call `history.pushState()` directly — it will update the URL but not trigger the router.

### `<app-router>`

Place `<app-router>` in your `index.html`. It is the single outlet for all page components:

```html
<body>
  <app-router></app-router>
  <script type="module" src="%%MAIN_JS%%"></script>
</body>
```

In `main.js`, set its `routes` property after import:

```js
import '../_lib/core/router/app-router.js';
import './pages/home-page.js';
import './pages/not-found-page.js';

const router = document.querySelector('app-router');
router.routes = [
  { path: '/',         component: 'home-page' },
  { path: '/goals/:id', component: 'goal-page' },
  { path: '*',         component: 'not-found-page' },
];
```

Routes are matched in order — first match wins. Use `*` as the last entry to catch unmatched paths.

### Route parameters

Segments prefixed with `:` are captured as named parameters and set on the page component as a `params` property before it renders. Use them directly in `template()`:

```js
class GoalPage extends AppElement {
  template() {
    return `<main><h1>Goal ${this.params.id}</h1></main>`;
  }
}
```

Parameter values are URI-decoded automatically.

### Page components

Every page component must wrap its content in `<main>` so assistive technologies can navigate directly to page content:

```js
class GoalPage extends AppElement {
  template() {
    return `
      <style>:host { display: block; }</style>
      <main>
        <h1>Goal detail</h1>
      </main>
    `;
  }
}

customElements.define('goal-page', GoalPage);
```

### Hard refresh and the SW navigation intercept

When a user navigates to `/goals/42` and then hard-refreshes, the browser requests `/goals/42` from the server. A static file server returns 404 — there is no file at that path.

The Service Worker solves this: it intercepts all navigation requests (requests with `mode === 'navigate'`) and returns the cached `index.html` instead. The app shell loads, the router reads the current URL, and renders the correct page. This is why offline-first and SPA routing work together without a server-side fallback.

The SW intercept is active after the first visit, once the SW has installed and taken control of the page.

## Store and IDB

The Store is the single source of truth for all app state. Components never touch IndexedDB directly — all reads come via `Store.subscribe()`. The CLI lets you pick one of two store variants at scaffold time:

| Store | IDB model | Use when |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| **Event log** (default) | Append-only event log, state replayed on boot | You need history, undo, P2P sync, or export |
| **Simple** | Single JSON snapshot, saved on every write | CRUD app, no audit trail needed, simpler mental model |

Both variants export the same `subscribe`, `unsubscribe`, `getState`, `attachBlob`, `getBlob`, `deleteBlob`, and `reset` API. They differ in how state is written and persisted.

---

### Event-log store

The event-log store records every state change as an immutable event in IndexedDB. State is derived by replaying the log through your reducer on every boot. Use this when you need history, undo, data export, or future P2P sync.

### Data model — append-only event log

All data is stored as an append-only log of events in IndexedDB. An event records what happened, not what the current state is:

```js
{
  id:         '550e8400-...',   // crypto.randomUUID()
  deviceId:   null,             // set by apps using P2P; null for single-device
  recordedAt: 1715000000000,    // Date.now() at write time — immutable
  occurredAt: 1715000000000,    // when the real-world event happened — correctable
  type:       'goal:added',
  payload:    { title: 'Run a 5k' },
}
```

`recordedAt` is the log ordering key — it records when the device wrote the event and is immutable. `occurredAt` records when the event happened in the real world; it can be user-supplied and corrected without affecting data integrity.

State is calculated by replaying the full event log through your reducer on every boot.

### Boot

Call `boot()` at the top of `main.js` and `await` it before the router or any component renders. Nothing else touches IDB at startup — this is the only entry point.

```js
import { boot } from '../_lib/core/store/store.js';
import { reducer } from './store/reducer.js';

await boot({ dbName: 'my-app', reducer });
```

`boot()` options:

| Option | Required | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `dbName` | yes | IDB database name — use your app name |
| `reducer` | yes | `(state, event) => newState` — called for every event on replay |
| `version` | no | IDB schema version — defaults to library's `CURRENT_VERSION` |
| `deviceId` | no | Identifies this device in P2P contexts — omit for single-device apps |

### Dispatch

```js
import { dispatch } from '../_lib/core/store/store.js';

await dispatch('goal:added', { title: 'Run a 5k' });

// With a custom occurredAt (e.g. user entered a past date):
await dispatch('goal:added', { title: 'Past goal' }, pastTimestamp);
```

`dispatch` writes the event to IDB, runs the reducer, then notifies subscribers of any changed state keys.

### Subscribe

```js
import { subscribe, unsubscribe } from '../_lib/core/store/store.js';

class GoalList extends AppElement {
  subscribe() {
    this._onGoals = goals => { /* update DOM */ };
    Store.subscribe('goals', this._onGoals);
  }
  unsubscribe() {
    Store.unsubscribe('goals', this._onGoals);
  }
}
```

`subscribe(key, cb)` calls `cb` immediately with the current value, then again whenever that top-level state key changes. Call `unsubscribe` in the component's `unsubscribe()` lifecycle method to avoid memory leaks.

### Writing a reducer

Your reducer lives in `app/store/reducer.js`. It receives the current state and one event, and must return a new state object:

```js
export function reducer(state, event) {
  switch (event.type) {
    case 'goal:added':
      return { ...state, goals: [...(state.goals ?? []), event.payload] };
    default:
      return state;
  }
}
```

The reducer must be a pure function — no side effects, no IDB calls, no mutation of the existing state object. The Store detects changes using reference equality (`!==`), so always return a new object when state changes.

### Schema migrations

The IDB schema is versioned from day one. Migrations live in `core/idb/migrations.js` — add a new function to the array when you need a new object store or index:

```js
// core/idb/migrations.js
const migrations = [
  null,       // slot 0 — IDB versions start at 1
  db => {     // version 1 — initial schema
    const store = db.createObjectStore('events', { keyPath: 'id' });
    store.createIndex('by_recordedAt', 'recordedAt');
  },
  db => {     // version 2 — add a new store
    db.createObjectStore('snapshots', { keyPath: 'id' });
  },
];
```

Migrations run inside `boot()` before any state is replayed and before any UI renders. A failed migration throws, halting app startup visibly — it never silently corrupts data.

### API reference

#### `boot({ dbName, reducer, version?, deviceId? })`

Opens the IDB database, runs any pending migrations, replays the event log through `reducer`, and sets the initial state. Must be `await`ed in `main.js` before anything else runs. Rejects if migrations fail.

#### `dispatch(type, payload, occurredAt?)`

Writes a complete event to IDB, applies the reducer, and notifies subscribers of changed state keys. Throws if called before `boot`. Returns a Promise that resolves when the write is complete.

#### `subscribe(key, cb)`

Registers `cb` for changes to a top-level state key. Calls `cb` immediately with the current value. Call in your component's `subscribe()` lifecycle method.

#### `unsubscribe(key, cb)`

Removes a previously registered callback. No-op if the callback was not registered. Call in your component's `unsubscribe()` lifecycle method.

#### `setState(key, value)`

Updates a top-level state key in memory and notifies subscribers. Does not write to IDB — the value does not survive a page reload.

Use for ephemeral runtime state: UI flags, detection results, or any value that is not a domain event and should not appear in the event log.

```js
import { setState } from '../_lib/core/store/store.js';

setState('updateAvailable', true);
```

**Notes** — calling `setState` before `boot` is safe but the value will be wiped when `boot` runs and replays the event log.

#### `getState()`

Returns the current state snapshot. Use in tests and for debugging. Do not use in production component code — use `subscribe()` instead.

#### `attachBlob(id, blob)`

Writes `{ id, blob }` to the `images` object store. Use for binary data (photos, files) that must not go through the event log. Returns a Promise.

The `images` store is separate from `events` — blobs are not replayed on boot and are not part of the event log. Pair with a domain event that records the blob id so the relationship is auditable:

```js
const id = crypto.randomUUID();
await Store.attachBlob(id, file);
await Store.dispatch('year:image-set', { year: '2026', imageId: id });
```

Throws if called before `boot`.

#### `getBlob(id)`

Reads a blob record from the `images` store by id. Returns a Promise that resolves to the `blob` value, or `null` if not found. Throws if called before `boot`.

#### `deleteBlob(id)`

Removes a blob from the `images` store by id. Returns a Promise. Throws if called before `boot`.

#### `getAllEvents()`

Returns a Promise that resolves to all events in the `events` store, sorted by `recordedAt` ascending (with `deviceId` as tiebreaker). Used by the sync module — not for general use in components.

#### `getAllBlobs()`

Returns a Promise that resolves to all records in the `images` store as `[{ id, blob }]`. Used by the sync module.

#### `importEvents(events)`

Writes an array of pre-formed event objects directly to the `events` store, bypassing the reducer and subscribers. Used by the sync module during import — not for general use. The app must reload after calling this for the imported events to affect state.

#### `reset()`

Clears all module state. **Test isolation only — never call in production code.**

---

### Simple store

The simple store trades the event log for a plain object snapshot persisted to IDB on every `setState` call. There is no reducer, no replay, and no migration system — the IDB schema is created once on first boot with a single `state` object store.

Choose the simple store when your app is a straightforward CRUD tool with no need for history, undo, cross-device sync, or export of event history. If you're unsure, use the event-log store — you can always drop the log, but you can't reconstruct one retroactively.

The sync module works with both stores. For the simple store, `exportData()` serialises the full in-memory state snapshot as a single `simple:state` event; `importData()` restores it. Binary files, images, and the `.youryear` file format are identical across both stores.

#### Boot

```js
import { boot } from '../_lib/core/store/store-simple.js';

await boot({ dbName: 'my-app', initialState: { items: [] } });
```

`boot()` opens (or creates) the IDB database, reads the persisted snapshot, and merges it over `initialState`. Keys present in the snapshot overwrite `initialState`; keys missing from the snapshot keep the `initialState` default. `await` it before anything else in `main.js`.

`boot()` options:

| Option | Required | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `dbName` | yes | IDB database name — use your app name |
| `initialState` | no | Default state used on first run (before any writes) |

#### setState

```js
import { setState } from '../_lib/core/store/store-simple.js';

setState('items', [...currentItems, newItem]);
```

Updates a top-level state key, notifies subscribers, and persists the entire state to IDB. Unlike `setState` in the event-log store, this write **survives a page reload**.

#### subscribe / unsubscribe

Identical to the event-log store — see above.

#### API reference

##### `boot({ dbName, initialState? })`

Opens IDB, loads the persisted snapshot, and sets initial state. Must be `await`ed in `main.js` before any component renders.

##### `setState(key, value)`

Updates a top-level state key and persists the full state snapshot to IDB. Notifies subscribers synchronously. Returns `undefined` (the IDB write is fire-and-forget).

##### `getState()`

Returns the current state snapshot. Use in tests and event handlers. Do not use in component render paths — use `subscribe()` instead.

##### `subscribe(key, cb)` / `unsubscribe(key, cb)`

Same as the event-log store.

##### `attachBlob(id, blob)` / `getBlob(id)` / `deleteBlob(id)`

Same as the event-log store. Blobs are stored in a separate `images` object store and are not part of the state snapshot.

##### `reset()`

Clears all module state. **Test isolation only — never call in production code.**

## Strings and locale

`core/strings.js` is a flat key registry that enables user-visible strings to be externalised from components and translated. It is the foundation for multi-language support without introducing any runtime dependency.

### Basic usage

In `_lib/` components, every user-visible string comes from `t()`:

```js
import { t } from '../../core/strings.js';

template() {
  return `<button>${t('update.reload')}</button>`;
}
```

Register English defaults in `app/strings.js`, which must be the **first import in `app/main.js`** so strings are available before any component renders:

```js
// app/strings.js
import { defineStrings } from '../_lib/core/strings.js';

defineStrings({
  'update.reload':  'Reload',
  'update.dismiss': 'Dismiss',
});
```

### Multiple languages

`defineStrings(obj, locale)` accepts an optional locale parameter. Register all locale packs in `app/main.js` after `app/strings.js`:

```js
// app/main.js (imports are hoisted — order of import statements sets registration order)
import './strings.js';          // English defaults — must come first
import './locales/fr.js';       // French
import './locales/ca.js';       // Catalan
```

```js
// app/locales/fr.js
import { defineStrings } from '../_lib/core/strings.js';

defineStrings({
  'update.reload':  'Recharger',
  'update.dismiss': 'Ignorer',
}, 'fr');
```

### Switching locale

```js
import { setLocale, getLocale } from '../_lib/core/strings.js';

// Read persisted locale (falls back to 'en')
const current = getLocale();

// Switch and persist to localStorage, then reload so all components re-render
setLocale('fr');
location.reload();
```

`setLocale` writes to `localStorage`. `getLocale` reads from `localStorage` and defaults to `'en'`. On reload, `app/main.js` imports `strings.js` before anything renders — the active locale is already set when the first component connects.

`t(key)` resolves: active locale → `'en'` → key. It never returns an empty string.

### API reference

#### `defineStrings(obj, locale?)`

Registers string key/value pairs for a locale. Defaults to `'en'`. Call multiple times to register multiple locales. Merges into the existing registry — later calls for the same locale override earlier keys.

#### `t(key, params?)`

Returns the string for `key` in the active locale. Falls back to English, then to the key itself if no match is found.

Pass `params` to substitute `{placeholder}` tokens in the string:

```js
defineStrings({ 'export.year': 'Export {year}' });
t('export.year', { year: 2026 }); // → 'Export 2026'
```

#### `setLocale(locale)`

Sets the active locale and persists it to `localStorage`. Falls back to `'en'` if the locale has no registered strings.

#### `getLocale()`

Returns the active locale from `localStorage`, defaulting to `'en'`.

#### `reset()`

Clears all registered strings and resets the active locale to `'en'`. **Test isolation only.**

## Sync module (`modules/sync/`)

The sync module exports and imports the full app dataset — events and binary attachments — as a compressed binary file. It is optional: scaffolded apps include it only if selected at `npx socle` time. Works with both the event-log store and the simple store.

### File format

Exported files use a custom binary format (`.youryear` / app-specific extension). The first 4 bytes are the uncompressed ASCII magic `SCLE`; the remainder is a gzip-compressed binary payload containing the event log and all blobs. Format is detected by magic bytes, not by file extension — legacy `.json` exports remain importable regardless of what the file picker shows.

### Export

`exportData()` returns a `Uint8Array`. Pass it to `downloadExport()` with the desired filename.

```js
import { exportData, downloadExport } from './_lib/modules/sync/sync.js';

const data = await exportData();
downloadExport(data, 'myapp-all.youryear');
```

To export only a subset of events, pass an `eventFilter`:

```js
const data = await exportData({
  eventFilter: e => String(e.payload?.year) === '2026',
});
downloadExport(data, '2026-only.youryear');
```

Year-scoped export automatically includes only the blobs referenced by the filtered events.

### Import

`readImportFile()` detects the format from magic bytes and returns either a `Uint8Array` (binary) or a parsed object (legacy JSON). Pass the result to `importData()`.

```js
import { readImportFile, importData } from './_lib/modules/sync/sync.js';

const raw    = await readImportFile(file);   // Uint8Array or parsed JSON object
const result = await importData(raw);        // { eventsAdded, imagesAdded }
```

`importData()` is idempotent — events and blobs whose `id` already exists are silently skipped. The app must reload after import for new events to affect state.

### API reference

#### `exportData({ eventFilter? })`

Returns a `Promise<Uint8Array>` — the gzip-compressed binary payload with SCLE magic prefix. If `eventFilter` is provided, only matching events are included and blob export is scoped to blobs referenced by those events.

#### `importData(input)`

Accepts a `Uint8Array` (binary format) or a plain object (legacy JSON). Merges events and blobs into IDB, skipping duplicates. Returns `{ eventsAdded, imagesAdded }`.

#### `downloadExport(uint8, filename)`

Triggers a browser file download. `uint8` is the `Uint8Array` from `exportData()`; `filename` is the full filename including extension (the library does not dictate the extension — it is app-specific).

#### `readImportFile(file)`

Reads a `File` object (from a file input). Returns a `Promise<Uint8Array>` for binary files or a `Promise<object>` for legacy JSON files. Throws on invalid JSON or unreadable file.

## Service Worker

The SW source lives at `_lib/core/sw.js` — library-owned, never edited directly. The build processes it into `dist/sw.js`, injecting:

- `CACHE_VERSION` — `{version}-{hash}`, changes on every build
- `ASSETS` — the full enumerated list of files in `_lib/` and `app/`, with correct `BASE_PATH` prefixes
- `BASE_PATH` — URL prefix for navigation intercept

Cache strategy by resource type:

| Resource | Strategy |
|----------|----------|
| `version.json` | Network only — never cached, always fresh |
| `index.html`, JS, CSS | Cache first — updated via SW lifecycle |
| Static assets (hashed) | Cache first — filename changes when content changes |
| Other same-origin resources | Runtime caching — cached on first fetch |

On activate, all caches that do not match `CACHE_VERSION` are deleted, cleaning up stale assets from previous versions. The SW calls `clients.claim()` so it takes control on first install without requiring a page reload.

The build script enumerates every file under `_lib/` and `app/` for the pre-cache list, following symlinks. Any file added to either directory is automatically included on the next build.

For the full update flow — `<sw-manager>`, `<update-banner>`, skip-waiting, and the `version.json` check — see [sw-update-flow.md](sw-update-flow.md).

## Reference app

`reference-app/` is structured identically to a scaffolded user project, with one difference: `_lib/` is a symlink to the monorepo's `core/` and `modules/` directories rather than a copy. Library code changes are reflected immediately without a sync step.

The reference app proves every library feature works end-to-end before it is considered complete. If a feature cannot be demonstrated meaningfully in the reference app, it is not done.
